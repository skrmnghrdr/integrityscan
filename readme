first create a hash list of known good binaries:
python3 main.py -d bin/ -m -o test.txt


how to compare syntax:
python3 main.py --good-hash test.txt -c --dir bin/ --output results.txt


File is still a prototype, I also included the compiled file into one ELF (named: binarychecker ) for ease

code is stil pretty dirty but It works.

whole compiled binary is portable and is only 7.2MB in filesize. 
I would addmore functionality to it. The goal is to use only built in python libraries so it would be more flexible 


Future versions would include:
remote scanning
json exfiltration
maybe a gui.
